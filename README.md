# AI-Powered-Adaptive-Math-Learning-Prototype

An AI-powered adaptive learning system that helps children (ages 5–10) practice basic math skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
The app dynamically adjusts the difficulty of math puzzles based on learner performance using a machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier).

🚀 Features

🎯 Adaptive Difficulty: Automatically adjusts question difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard) based on accuracy and response time.

🧩 Dynamic Puzzle Generator: Generates new math problems for each difficulty level.

⏱ Performance Tracking: Records correctness, time taken, and progression.

📊 Visual Dashboard: Real-time charts for accuracy, response time, and difficulty transitions.

🤖 ML-Based Adaptive Engine: Uses a trained Decision Tree model with self-retraining using user performance.

💾 Data Logging: Saves learner sessions as CSV files for analysis.
